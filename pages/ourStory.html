                <h2>Our Story:</h2>
                <p>Welcome to our story, a narrative filled with determination, collaboration, and an unwavering desire to do things differently.</p>
                <p>We met at Instituto Arcos, united by a common passion: video games. After graduating in 2021, we dove headfirst into the world of game development, armed with skills in Unity, Unreal, and Construct. We also ventured into web development and mobile app development.</p>
                <p>With two years of experience in the industry, we have worked on both our own projects and collaborations with renowned studios like C2 Game Studio. Our work on Monolith: Requiem of the Ancients gave us a significant boost, but we didn't stop there. We have also delved into developing educational games for institutions like Senda and the Interactive Milk Museum.</p>
                <p>Upon leaving Instituto Arcos, we decided to take the leap and create our own company. We wanted full control over our projects and the ability to bring others' ideas to life. Thus, "RoboFrog" was born, with the mission of offering innovative and exciting gaming experiences for all types of players.</p>
                <p>Every day, we work tirelessly to achieve our goal. We are excited to share our story with you and hope you join us on this journey full of challenges and achievements.</p>
                <p>Welcome to our story!</p>
